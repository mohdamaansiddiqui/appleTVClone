2nd Collaborative Project at Masai School as“Apple TV+” clone.
Before I proceed with my words, I would like to thank Masai School for this wonderful opportunity of learning and showcase my skills.
We as a team tried our level best to get the desired output through our so far journey of knowledge.

About the Project-
We had to make a replica of “Apple TV+”, a product of well known American company called “Apple”.
“It offers a selection of original production film and television series called Apple Originals”. You can stream it at any time with 7 days free & then a minimal fee of 99/month.
It was launched in late 2019 and since then it was very popular among the people of various countries.
We have tried our best to make a replica of it.

Now we all have the ability to read others’ code.
How to work in a team.
How to be more efficient when there is a fixed time slot to complete the work.
How to communicate with each other through different methods like Github, Whatsapp, Slack, and Zoom meetings.
How to use Github, which will be useful for us when we will move to the industry as well.
What problems we can face working in a team.
And most important “How to be always open to the new learnings”, as this world evolving so fast.
At last, I would like to thank Masai School for their guidance & My Teammates for their support & choosing me to lead this project.
